# Azure OpenAI Chat Samples using REST calls
This repository is a set of docments that cover differing aspects of using OpenAI chat - but at the HTTP REST level to remove the mystery of what application code can do with OpenAI. Chat with your own data and how to work with Azure Search Indexes is also covered.

## Who is this for?
The intention is to give low-level information to those that develop with OpenAI about how things work. I have included *.http* files that may be directly used in Visual Studio Code to allow you to try these for yourself outside an application.
